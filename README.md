# File Hash Value Generator
This Java Swing GUI Tool allows users to generate the unique Hash Value of a specified file on thier machine. Hashing is an algorithm used in order to calculate a fixed-size Hexidecimal Representation of a file. Each file is composed of multiple blocks of data which can be read and condensed down into smaller segments. These segments are then further condensed until a single hexidecimal byte of data is calculated. From here, depending on the Hashing Algorithm used, the newly calculated bytes are finally condensed down into a fixed-size string of data having the character length associated with the user's chosen Hashing Algorithm Type.

This Application Features Seven Different Hash Algorithm Formulas:
